# COGS118A Project
This is my final group project from an undergraduate machine learning course at UC San Diego.

This project focused on a dataset of Amazon reviews of women's clothing. The goal of the project was to use machine learning methods to build a model that classifies customer reviews into clothing categories in order to recommend a specific category of products to Amazon customers.

The main algorithm used in this project is a multi-class classification using logistic regression. Through model and algorithm selection we arrived at a model that takes a reivew and reviewer information and classifies them into 6 different categories of women's clothing with an accuracy of 65%.

Through this hands-on project, I reinforced my prior knowledge of various machine learning and data science concepts including multiclass classification using One vs. Rest strategy, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear SVM, processes of model selection and algorithm selection, model evaluation metrics and the limitations of real life datasets.
