# COGS118A Project
This is my final group project from an undergraduate machine learning course at UC San Diego.

This project focused on a dataset of Amazon reviews of women's clothing. The goal of the project was to use machine learning methods to build a model that classifies customer reviews into clothing categories in order to recommend a specific category of products to Amazon customers.

The main algorithm used in this project is a multi-class classification using logistic regression. Through model and algorithm selection we arrived at a model that takes a reivew and reviewer information and classifies them into 6 different categories of women's clothing with an accuracy of 65%.

Through this project, I reinforced my prior knowledge of various machine learning techniques while tackling an original research question hands-on.
